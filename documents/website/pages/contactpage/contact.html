        Where to begin! My name is Audriana Linares, I'm 27 years old and I absolutely love to capture special moments on camera. I started photography when I was 18 years old and have been developing my style and technique ever since. When I'm not out taking pictures I work full time for a local pharmacy and part-time student learning web development. My true love, however, is photography. I love taking pictures of weddings: the look on the groom's face when the bride walks down the aisle, the father-daughter dance, you can just feel the love in the air. I enjoy capturing graduations: the ending of one chapter and moving onto the next! I absolutely adore taking maturnity and new born photos and this list goes on! Hire me for your photography needs and you will not be dissapointed!
